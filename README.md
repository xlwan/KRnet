# KRnet

We provide an deep invertible mapping that can be used for generative modeling and density estimation. The algorithm is defined in *[K. Tang, X. Wan and Q. Liao, Deep density estimation via invertible block-triangular mapping, Theoretical & Applied Mechanics Letters, 10 (2020), 000-5]*, which can be found  [here](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~xlwan/papers/journal).

KRnet provides a generalization of the [real NVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) for density estimation.
